# HomeCo – Market Opportunity Sizing Analysis

## Business Context

HomeCo is a national mortgage provider offering residential, commercial, and development lending solutions. As part of a strategy initiative, this analysis was designed to uncover underpenetrated customer segments, high-volume low-approval regions, and product types showing latent demand.

This wasn’t just an exploration of volume. It was an exercise in discovering **where HomeCo is missing opportunity**.

## Analysis Objectives

- Identify **markets with high application volume but low approval success**
- Segment applicants based on financial profiles using unsupervised clustering
- Score applications using decision trees to understand approval likelihood
- Size market potential by region, product, and customer type

---

## Key Insights

- **Quebec and Manitoba** had large volumes of unapproved mortgage applications  
- **Construction** and **HELOC** loans had lower approval success across all regions  
- **First-time buyers** and **self-employed applicants** represent untapped loan value  
- **Four clusters** emerged based on loan size, interest rate, and term characteristics  
- Product type and customer segment were the top drivers of approval in the scoring model

## So What?

> **HomeCo is at risk of under-serving valuable markets.**

Without targeted intervention, high-value applicants—especially in risk-sensitive products—may continue to churn. The data revealed clear **strategic opportunities**:

### Immediate
- Target retention and re-engagement efforts in **Quebec and Manitoba**

### Short-Term
- Improve **digital onboarding** and **broker workflows** for self-employed and first-time buyers

### Long-Term
- Review pricing and underwriting criteria for Construction and HELOC products

This project translates insight into action, supporting product design, risk review, and regional strategy.
